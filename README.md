Data Encryption is a method of preserving data confidentiality by transforming it into ciphertext, which can only be decoded using a unique decryption key produced at the time of the encryption or before it. The conversion of plaintext into ciphertext is known as encryption.

DES is a block cipher and encrypts data in blocks of size of 64 bits each, which means 64 bits of plain text go as the input to DES, which produces 64 bits of ciphertext. DES encrypts and decrypts data in 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key. Its simple, iterative structure makes it fast and efficient, but also vulnerable to brute-force attacks as computing power has increased over time.
